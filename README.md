# fluidy-testing-challenge

### The challenge
The aim of this exercise is to demonstrate your problem solving and understanding of JavaScript by implementing something found in every unit testing tool - an "assertEquals" method.

### To do:
•	Fill in the "assertEquals" function provided such that it will correctly compare the "expected" and "actual" parameters.
•	The parameters could be of any conceivable JavaScript type, but we only expect you to handle primitive data types (e.g. strings and numbers) and simple arrays to start with
•	You can work with the code we've given you, or rewrite bits if that works best for you. You may add extra functions and files as you see fit.
•	Credit will be given for approach, correctness, clean code, and testing.
•	The set of tests provided isn't exhaustive - there are many cases not covered here. We expect you to add additional tests, and to amend ours as you see fit.
•	We don't expect you to progress to dealing with more complex data types than those shown here.
•	We respect your time, and - assuming you are already familiar with JavaScript - we do not expect you to spend more than an hour doing this exercise.


### Additional terms
•	Please do not use external libraries (except for a testing library)
•	You may of course use any resources you like to assist you with specific techniques, syntax etc - but please do not just copy code.
•	Please don't share this exercise with anyone else :)
•	We've written some initial tests for you using Jest, which is our testing library of choice. You may use a different library if you wish.
